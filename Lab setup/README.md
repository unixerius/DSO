# Instructions

Follow ONE of the following sets of instructions.

I advise you to NOT use VMWare on MacOS ARM; it does not play well with Vagrant at all.

* [HyperV on Windows, with x86_64](https://github.com/unixerius/DSO/blob/main/Lab%20setup/HyperV-instructions.md)
* [VirtualBox on Windows, MacOS or Linux, with x86_64](https://github.com/unixerius/DSO/blob/main/Lab%20setup/VirtualBox-instructions.md)
* [Libvirt and KVM on Linux, with x86_64](https://github.com/unixerius/DSO/blob/main/Lab%20setup/KVM-Libvirt-instructions.md)
* [Qemu on MacOS, with aarch64](https://github.com/unixerius/DSO/blob/main/main/Qemu-instructions.md)
* [UTM on MacOS, with aarch64](https://github.com/unixerius/DSO/blob/main/main/UTM-instructions.md)

Using these instructions you will do the following:

1. Download and install the required software.
2. Download a Vagrant configuration file and use it to setup a new Vagrant project.
3. Use Vagrant to create and install the VM.
