# Introduction

This directory contains mini-trainings and presentations which Tess gives at customers and conferences. I am including them here, because they are also relevant to DevSecOps. 

There are also YouTube recordings of two of these presentations:

* [Introduction to cryptography, certificates and PKI.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ViwiXA-K)
* [Implementing an AppSec program.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxYAiVKSL0A)
